<p> We use input streams and try-catch blocks to take user input to choose what kind of attacks they want to do - normal or special. Normal attacks do less damage than
special attacks, but special attacks temporarily lower your defense</p>
<p> For the most part, the on screen prompts are more than enough to play the game - simply clone this repo (use the master branch), and compile the file titled "YoRPG.java" and then run said file. There are several stats that play a role in combat here - HP, attack rating, defense, and strength. Defense negates damage, and HP is simply how much damage it takes to kill you. Attack rating is a multiplier that, with strength, determines how much damage you do per attack. </p>
<p> You have three lives before the game is over - or until you have run into 10 monsters. </p>
<p> The difficulty determines how often you run into monsters</p>
<p> We hope you enjoy this MASTERPIECE</p>
